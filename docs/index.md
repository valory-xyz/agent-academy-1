El Collectooorr aims to autonomously create collections of NFTs by minting them as they drop on Art Blocks. It uses complex logic to decide which mints to participate in and what prices to bid at, so users donâ€™t have to. The service is fueled by the community of users who fund collections. Each collection is designed to have its own unique ERC-20 token, for users to vote and collectively decide on what happens to the collection.
